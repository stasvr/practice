# Practice at Deep Learning

This repository contains deep learnning models implemented using [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) and [Keras](https://keras.io/).
It is an educational repository. All papers, github code or other materials that was used to implement or to understand and build models are linked below.

Versions: TensorFlow - 1.6.0 ; Keras - 2.1.4 (tensorflow as backend)
